* I'm an org babel for data science evangelist!
Seriously this is great -- it's changed my life. Will write more on that later.

* Org Mode
** <2024-09-23 Mon> Some struggles getting org publish to work, but I finally have a webpage
- spaces in folders break link exports >: , maybe work around idk
- auto inserted links ( via SPC n l -> C-c C-l workflow) were not always relative,

   fixed maybe with
   #+begin_src elisp

(setq org-link-file-path-type 'relative)
   #+end_src

   or possibly with the correct configuration in publish.el

 or possibly by making it a project,

- so much slower in doom than batching it out , so I just emacs --batch -l ./publish.el
*** TODO Fix latex exports

* Dired features I'm enjoying

** wdired is magic
** ! then command (e.g. firefox) on the highlighted file = yay
** tab on a file
** M for changing permissions
** Mapping W to dired-do-eww
