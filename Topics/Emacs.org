Seriously this is great -- it's changed my life.

** TODO actually that gets published to an html, how do I fix this
** TODO Write a blog post explaining how this has changed my life

* Org Mode
** <2024-09-23 Mon> Some struggles getting org publish to work, but I finally have a webpage
- spaces in folders break link exports >: , maybe work around idk
- auto inserted links ( via SPC n l -> C-c C-l workflow) were not always relative,

   fixed maybe with
   #+begin_src elisp

(setq org-link-file-path-type 'relative)
   #+end_src

   or possibly with the correct configuration in publish.el

 or possibly by making it a project,

- so much slower in doom than batching it out , so I just emacs --batch -l ./publish.el
*** TODO Fix latex exports

* Dired
