#+title: (Non-theoretical) Computer Science

* Tools I love:

** Emacs

I have a whole page for emacs, but it deserves a bullet here.

I love being able to shape my editor into a glove that fits me and my idiosyncrasies. It's so much better than shaping myself to fit an awkward tool. Getting good at emacs has made development a million times more fun, and this leads to more flow, and to more creativity.

** Nix

I do most of my personal development through a nixos vm running with UTM on my mac. I love being able to version my system configuration, and steal bits of config from friends.

(I do like having this live inside of a computer that's stable, and that just *works*.)

I also use nix as my package manager for python environments at home. Sometimes requires terrible overlays but at least it's hermetic and aesthetic. ^^

** Git

I love git so much.

I didn't always love git, I used to be afraid of messing it up.

Then I asked for help and read pro-git.
