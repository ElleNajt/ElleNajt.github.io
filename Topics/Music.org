* Favorites

I like a mix of classical, jazz, video game music, breakcore / electronic music, and genres in between these things.

Here are some favorites:

** Classical:

*** Wendy Carlos Switched on Bach

** Jazz:
Mostly what I like about jazz are creative twists on things I'm familiar with, so I tend to like:

*** Jazzy versions of classical music

*** Jazzy versions of video game music

** Video Game Music:

*** Soundtrack of Celeste
