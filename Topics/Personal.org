* Meditation

I practice lovingkindness meditation, specifically [[https://www.dhammasukha.org/beginner-lovingkindness][TWIM]], which has been very impactful for me.

* Clowning

I'm interested in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_clowning][Pochinko clowning]] as an art form and spiritual practice.

#+begin_src quote
Pochinko taught clowning as a sort of "reverse therapy", in which instead of
ridding oneself of anxieties, the clown performer leans into their own
insecurities and foibles in order to package them as comedy.

* Burning man

I went to burning man for the first time this year (2024), and had a great time, and am planning to go back.

Living in a culture that valued radical self-expression, participation and immediacy in the way Black Rock City did [[https://burningman.org/about/10-principles/][(see the 10 principles)]] was especially impactful.
