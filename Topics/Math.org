Here are the math topics I'm interested in:

* Statistics $\mathbb{P}(A)$

* Assorted Pure Math  $\mathcal{F}$

* Theoratical Computer Science $T(x)$

* Competition Math $x + y \geq 2\sqrt{xy}$

I wasn't very good at competition math in high school, so I'm enjoying learning how to become good at it as a means of doing some emotional processing and improving my general problem solving skills.
